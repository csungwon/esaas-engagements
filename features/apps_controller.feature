Feature: after a user logins with their github id they can create an app or modify and destroy and existing app

  As a user who first opens the app
  So that I can efficiently create, edit or destroy an app
  I want to return to the apps page I requested to login

Background: users, orgs and apps have been added to database
  Given the following apps exist:
        | name  | description | org_id | status  |
        | app1  | test        | 1      | pending |
        | app2  | test        | 1      | pending |
        | app3  | test        | 1      | pending |

    And the following orgs exist:
        | name | contact_id | contact_name|
        | org1 | 1          | user1|
        | org2 | 1          | user2|
        | org3 | 1          | user3|

    And the following users exist:
        | name  | github_uid      | email         |
        | user1 | esaas_developer | test@user.com |
        | user2 |                 | test@user.com |
