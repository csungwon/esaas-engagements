Feature: Users can choose a type of comment on app

	AS a staff that manages the matching between a project and customers
	SO THAT I can easily keep track of an app's progress of customer matching
	I WANT the app page have different comment types not only for general comments, but also for contact progress

Background:
	And the following users exist:
		| name 				| github_uid 		| email 						|
		| ESaaS Developer 	| esaas_developer	| esaas_developer@saasbook.info	|
		| Armando Fox 		| armandofox 		| fox@berkeley.edu				|
		| Adnan Hemani		| adnanhemani		| adnan.h@berkeley.edu			|

	And the following orgs exist:
        | name | contact_id |
        | org1 | 2          |
        | org2 | 2          |
        | org3 | 2          |

    Given the following apps exist:
		| name  | description | org_id | status  |
		| app1  | test        | 1      | pending |
		| app2  | test        | 2      | pending |
		| app3  | test        | 3      | pending |

	And I am logged in
	And I follow "app1"
