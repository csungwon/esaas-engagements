Scenario: A customer can fill out a feedback form and submit it
    Given I am on the feedback form page for engagement id "1" and iteration id "1"
    Then I should see "Please enter your feedback below."
    And I fill in the "Feedback" fields as follows:
        | field                 | value                  |
        | duration              | choose "1 hour"        |
        | demeanor              | choose "Mostly agree"  |
        | engaged               | choose "Mostly agree"  |
        | engaged_text          | They were engaged      |
        | communication         | choose "Mostly agree"  |
        | communication_text    | They communicated well |
        | understanding         | choose "Mostly agree"  |
        | understanding_text    | They understood well   |

        | effectiveness_text    | They were effective    |
        | satisfied             | choose "Mostly agree"  |
        | satisfied_text        | I am satisfied         |

    And I press "Submit"
    Then I should see "Thank you!"
    When I am on the edit engagement iteration page for engagement id "1" and iteration id "1"
    Then the "feedback form" fields should be filled as follows:

        | duration              | 1 hour                 |
